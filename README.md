# Simple typescript debugging environment

I created this repo to get be able to quickly get a TypeScript environment which I can use to debug code for leetcode challenges. 

It uses Nodemon to enable building the TypeScript files on save.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. To start the Nodemon sever, run `npm run dev`.
